- Webpage is based from SnowfallEffect page.
- The snow generating and animation are modified and improved from normal version, it will generate and fall from the top dynamically.
(It won't reuse the same snow value which is fallen to the bottom of the screen as it is in the original version, it will be removed and generate a new one instead)
- Input Konami code to activate or deactivate the effect (Konami code input sequence: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, b, a), input by keyboard (make sure that the language is English).
